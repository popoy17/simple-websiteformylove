      <h2>My Dearest Ms.longganisa,</h2>
      <p>I hope this letter finds you warmth by love. I wanted to express my feelings in a special way, so I created this simple website just for you.</p>
      <p>In the past months of courting you, I have discovered so much about you, and my love for you gets stronger every day. It is fair to say that it has been an amazing journey filled with wonderful moments and priceless memories.</p>
      <p>Through thick and thin, come what may. Even when challenges arise that are difficult to comprehend, I am ready to listen, to love, and hold your hand.</p>
      <p>Despite the fact that I fell short sometimes, there is no quitting from my side. You should be aware that even if things get tougher than anything else does; our love will battle on. Within my dark world Audrey, you became the light that brings color and meaning into each single day.</p>
      <p>It is because of this reason that I’m happy for your existence in my life Audrey. Meeting you was a blessing in disguise which brought happiness and affectionate feelings more than anyone can ever imagine or replicate. Thank you for being a part of my world.</p>
       <p>May your Valentine day be filled with love and joy.</p>
      <p>Yours lovingly,</p>
